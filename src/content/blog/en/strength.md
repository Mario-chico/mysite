## Why?

To live **independently** of physical fit you need 3 things

- Activate neurons to move muscles.
- Contract muscles.
- Move bones with muscles.

And for all this it is required to use <u>strength</u>.

While we enjoy our younger ages we tend to take this for granted and not pay much attention, as we reach 40 something happens we **lose** 2-4 percent of strength each year!

Double that of muscle loss (which is still very important to preserve muscle).

In terms of old age, it is specific to preserve muscle strength and power, so you don't fall or you can stop a fall.

If you are enjoying younger ages you will find enormous benefits in increasing your strength, not only in athletic performance, but also in mental health, daily life and in bed.

## What is it?

Create more force through a muscle or group of muscles that work to perform an action.

- Stopping the impact of a fall
- Lift your loved ones
- Carry your jugs
- Move objects without the need of a pair

It can also be for a specific objective such as a competition or personal goal.

It does not focus on aesthetics. That is not to say that you can't make muscle gains with this modality. 

Actually the loss of strength is not due to age, it is due to **lack of training**.

## How do I do it?

The main factor in making a profit is consistency in the program. <u>Trust the process</u>.

Consider putting your program together as follows:

1. Choose 3-5 exercises per workout.
2. Do 3-5 sets per exercise
3. Perform 3-5 repetitions per set
4. Rest 3-5 minutes between each set.
5. Repeat this 3-5 times per week.
