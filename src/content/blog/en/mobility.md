## Why?

Freedom is lost when mobility is lacking, our decisions to travel or activities to do are limited and we lose confidence.
It is believed that when you reach 30 your body goes into decline and there is nothing you can do about it.
You only lose what you don't use and if you choose not to prioritize your body and the way it moves, you will see limitations in a short time.

Joint limitations and restricted mobility can lead to chronic pain, stiffness, injury and stagnant strength. 

## What is it?

Increase overall body range of motion and flexibility.
This results in pain reduction, injury resilience and improved athletic performance.
It's not just stretching and that's it, it's about strengthening 
- joints
- connective tissue
- muscles
- increased range of motion

## How do I do it?

Listen to your body and its ailments.

- Perform movements in the 3 planes (up-down, left-right, rotation) in a slow and controlled manner.
- 30 minutes a day.
- Minimum 3 times a week.
