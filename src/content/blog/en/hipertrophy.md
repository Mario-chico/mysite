## Why?

This is of interest to you if you want:
- Bigger arms
- Bigger buttocks
- You have osteoporosis and it's a health need

Preserving a healthy nervous system over time is necessary to enjoy our movements and feel comfortable performing them, no matter how old we are.

As time goes by and we reach 40, 1-2 percent of muscle mass is reduced each year.

This doesn't happen because of age, you can get to that age and not see reductions. It happens because there is a lack of training.

Growing muscle, no matter the goal, is to keep the nervous system healthy and young.

## What is it?

To make the muscle or muscle groups grow.

It does not have a functional purpose, it is simply to make it grow and it tends to be related to aesthetics.

Usually this is thought of as the aesthetic part, however it is different to grow the size of the muscles than to make the fat disappear so that it can be seen.

## How do I do it?

The truth is that you can do a lot of things, and they are all likely to work. Honestly the 7 variables to modify[^listnote] alone don't make the change between growing muscle and not growing muscle.

What does?

- You have to have a larger stimulus. The net stress has to be large.
- You have to send that signal from the outside (muscle) to the nucleus, which is inside the muscle.
- Activate protein synthesis, and have the aminos and energy necessary to make it happen.

And it's not that you can do whatever you want, it's that you have many options and you can vary from one to another.

Why super sets work? and why dropsets or muscle sets or heavy loads or light loads or greater range of motion or not much range?

Because it modifies the variables and fulfills the 3 steps described above.

[^listnote] Modified Variables:
    - Choice: The selection of exercises to target specific muscles or movements.
    - Order: The sequence in which exercises are performed, which can affect muscle fatigue and stimulus.
    - Volume: Total amounts of sets and repetitions, influencing muscle growth.
    - Intensity: The percentage of the maximum load used (e.g., percentage of one repetition maximum).
    - Frequency: How often a muscle group is trained per week.
    - Rest: The duration of rest between sets, affecting recovery and intensity sustainability.
    - Progression: How we progress in the following weeks.
