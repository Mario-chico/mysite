## Why?

Enjoying our atmosphere is not something that only happens in early stages of life, we can enjoy our body and all its capabilities to the fullest regardless of age, making our passage through old age is satisfactory and enjoy health.

If you lose strength and functionality in your body it reduces your desire to travel, take a plane or truck, carry your suitcases, loved ones or your grocery bags, this also produces problems such as lack of social connection or loss of purpose by not leaving home.

## What is it?

Keep your heart functional, especially if you are a man.

In addition to prolonging your life span, it's about living in wellness.

It's not about being the strongest person in the world, breaking world records, or being the most powerful person in the gym, it's about **keeping your life functional and feeling good**.

In addition to maintaining good heart health, strength is another indicator of longevity, specifically leg strength. And this is because you are usually more physically active when training, if you lose leg strength it is a result of lack of movement. Similarly it is because when you fall and do not stop the impact, you get hurt (hip, pelvis or broken legs).

This happens because as life progresses there is

- Loss of balance.
- Increased stumbling.
- Loss of strength to stop the impact

## How do I do it?

In addition to training different physical aspects, it is very important to spend time in nature, with your loved ones, doing activities that nourish your soul, express feelings and emotions.

- Train VO2 Max, which is the ability to take in and use the oxygen that comes in.
- Strength in legs and grip.
- Muscle mass to preserve strength and power.
- Balance.
- Quickness in the feet, so if you are going to fall you can rectify the direction and prevent it.

And enjoy the process, recognize each step you make, because the final purpose is to live great.
