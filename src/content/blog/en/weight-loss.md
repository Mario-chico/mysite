## Why?

There are too many benefits to obtain, and the main depends on your situation and purposes.

- Improved mental and emotional health.
- Improved sex hormones.
- Your heart thanks you
- Increased mobility and reduced joint pain
- Insulin sensitivity

To be physically independent, you must be able to move.
It is a step to total wellness that lasts a lifetime if you decide to keep it.

## What is it?

It is to make the fat leave the body.
And this happens with breathing.

That's why there are many methods and they all work, not because they are super intense or you sweat a lot (Fat is not lost by sweating).

For this to happen you must restrict something, calories consumed, leisure time to train or walk long distances, pre activities to be able to recover better.

It doesn't have to be all lettuce and tomatoes and you don't have to restrict everything at the same time, it's not a path of suffering.

Nutrition plays a very important role in this type of training.

## How do I do?

Do not breathe excessively, that leads to hyperventilation and very soon you will realize that this is not the way.

We have better methods, among them:

- Choose something you like and if you don't like anything go for long walks in parks or ecological reserves in your city, or in the street. Decide on something to do.
- Reflect on what makes you overeat (if any) and identify the moments that trigger that action.
- Change foods high in sugars for other protein or fiber, which help to satiate more.
- Raise your heart rate throughout the day (10 seconds of jumping jacks every 3 hours).
- DO IT EVERY DAY.

DON'T OBSESS ABOUT CALORIES.

And at all times, remember to treat yourself well and love yourself. Recognize your achievements, celebrate them. At the end of the road what you are looking for is wellness, but we do not find it at the end, it is in the whole process.
